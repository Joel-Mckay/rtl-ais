- Auto calibration mode
- Compile as library
- Add audio gain control 

#TO DO: Suggest brute-force step-and-check tuning (reuse ram buffer data)
# as peak detection will not work well alone. Thus, we must scan each band 
# tuning region with +- 0.002MHz for best SNR stats.
# If we maximize valid packet counts, than the off-peak-center packet data should be better.
